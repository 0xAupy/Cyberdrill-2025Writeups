Category: Steganography
Tool Used: zsteg
🔍 Challenge Summary
We were provided with a PNG file named stego.png. The goal was to extract any hidden data from the image.

🛠️ Steps to Solve
We used the zsteg tool, which is commonly used to extract hidden text and data from PNGs using various LSB and bit-plane techniques:

bash
zsteg stego.png
This gave us several interesting outputs, but one in particular stood out:

bash
b1,rgb,lsb,xy       .. text: "79:#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    printf(\"Th15_1s_RC!\");\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\nVrP"
This snippet shows a simple C program where the printf() function reveals the flag directly.

🎯 Flag
WTISD{Th15_1s_RC!}
